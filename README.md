This repository contains the project files for a Smart Home Light Sensor system, designed using Tinkercad. The project utilizes Arduino and C++ to create an automated lighting system that adjusts based on the ambient light levels.

---
## Features:
*  <b>Light Sensing:</b> The system uses a light sensor to detect the intensity of ambient light.

*  <b>Automatic Lighting:</b>  Based on the sensor readings, the system can turn lights on or off to maintain optimal lighting conditions in the home.

*  <b>Arduino Integration:</b>  The project is built around an Arduino microcontroller, providing a versatile and programmable platform for the sensor and light control logic.

*  <b>C++ Programming:</b>  The control logic and sensor management are implemented in C++, taking advantage of the language's efficiency and capabilities for hardware interaction.

---
## Getting Started:
*  <b>Tinkercad Simulation:</b> You can simulate the project using Tinkercad to understand the setup and functionality.

*  <b>Arduino Setup:</b> Follow the instructions to set up the Arduino with the necessary components, including the light sensor and LEDs.

*  <b>Code Deployment:</b> Upload the provided C++ code to the Arduino to enable the smart light sensor functionality.

This repository contains the project files for a Smart Home Light Sensor system, designed using Tinkercad. The project utilizes Arduino and C++ to create an automated lighting system that adjusts based on the ambient light levels.
---
## Features:
---
* Light Sensing: The system uses a light sensor to detect the intensity of ambient light.
* Automatic Lighting: Based on the sensor readings, the system can turn lights on or off to maintain optimal lighting conditions in the home.
* Arduino Integration: The project is built around an Arduino microcontroller, providing a versatile and programmable platform for the sensor and light control logic.
* C++ Programming: The control logic and sensor management are implemented in C++, taking advantage of the language's efficiency and capabilities for hardware interaction.
---
## Getting Started:
---
* Tinkercad Simulation: You can simulate the project using Tinkercad to understand the setup and functionality..
* Arduino Setup: Follow the instructions to set up the Arduino with the necessary components, including the light sensor and LEDs.
* Code Deployment: Upload the provided C++ code to the Arduino to enable the smart light sensor functionality.
